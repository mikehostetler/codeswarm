## Overview
CodeSwarm is an Open Source [Continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) and [Continuous Deployment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment)
system built with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) and [Docker](http://docker.io/).  CodeSwarm is built with plugins, providing tremendous flexibility.


# Important
A new release of CodeSwarm is coming that has many bugs fixed and a completely new UI.  It will be opened up mid-June, 2014.  We don't recommend using this version yet.
